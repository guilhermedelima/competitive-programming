Some code that i wrote for algorithm competition.


Usage
=======================

Inside each folder there's a makefile with the commands:

make n-% : creates src/%.cpp for source code and resource/%.txt for inputs

make c-% : compiles src/%.cpp with g++

make %   : compiles and runs src/%.cpp with the inputs from resource/%.txt
